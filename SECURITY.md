# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

The tool is more or less a rolling release. I am trying to fix issues right away. The most recent release version is the one supported.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Security issues are welcome to be reported in the issue section. Please be precise how to reproduce the issue including the version you use, the OS you run on and possibly the request you made or a Proof-of-Concept command line.

I will try to assess the issues as soon as possible.
